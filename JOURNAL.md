This is a short cronical of my thoughts as I build this project.

Super excited, though this is kind of foolish. I just witnessed my first unexpected behavior in the NPCs.
'Dog Meat' which I programmed to follow my charector primarilly randomly started to follow one of the randomly generated rats.
I did not intend for Dog Meat to do this. Exciting things are on the horizon.
