##NPC Logic:

inputs > outputs

###Inputs:
* find nearest
* in line of site
* in front of
* to the left of
* to the right of
* object in inventory

###Outputs:
* move forward,backward, left, right
* equip object
* use equipped object
* interact

#####Random Thought:
Possibly do separate inputs/outputs for economics and interactions.
